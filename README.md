# Tensorflow problem sheet solution

## Introduction
The following is a 4th year in-class assignment for Emerging technologies. These problems relate to the Python package Tensorflow. We will again use the famous iris data set. Please see the jupyter notebook `solution.ipynb` for the code and all of the documentation.

## Assignment Specification

### 1. Use Tensorflow to create model

Use Tensorflow to create a model to predict the species of Iris from a flowerâ€™s sepal width, sepal length, petal width, and petal length.

### 2. Split the data into training and testing

Split the data set into a training set and a testing set. You should investigate the best way to do this, and list any online references used in your notebook. If you wish to, you can write some code to randomly separate the data on the fly.

### 3. Train the model

Use the testing set to train your model.

### 4. Test the model

Use the testing set to test your model, clearly calculating and displaying the error rate.

## How to clone this repository

* In the Clone with HTTPs section, copy the clone URL for the repository.
* Open Git Bash.
* Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
* Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 2.
* Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

## How to open the jupyter notebook
The Jupyter Notebook App can be launched by clicking on the Jupyter Notebook icon installed by Anaconda in the start menu (Windows) or by typing in a terminal (cmd on Windows):

`jupyter notebook`

This will launch a new browser window (or a new tab) showing the Notebook Dashboard, a sort of control panel that allows (among other things) to select which notebook to open.

Look for the folder which you have previously cloned named `python-problems4` - open it and click on `solution.ipynb`
